# WARNING: the order MUST be "API first, cache only as fallback" -- never the

# written by sync.sh; in practice it drifts badly from the real latest version
# (observed: cache said 1.3.0 while the version history's items[0] was 2.2.2),
# and it is not invalidated when the Hub publishes a new version after a sync.
# A cache-first implementation therefore silently installs an OLD version *and*
# replaces the whole directory of the newer copy the user already had --
# irreversible data loss. `/versions/<slug>?limit=1` items[0] is the source of
# truth.

# endpoint always serves the latest. If a specific version is requested we honor

# with the legacy local codepage, so non-ASCII names become mojibake on disk

# the installed skill that opens the file by its real name then raises
# FileNotFoundError -- it looks like "the skill installed fine but crashes on
# first run", and the blame lands on the installed skill instead of the
# installer. `unzip -O UTF-8` exists only in the Windows build (the Linux build
# fails with a usage error), so there is no flag-level workaround.
